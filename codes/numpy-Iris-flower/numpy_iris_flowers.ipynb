    "Using the implemented functions, we were able to calculate the distance between each test sample and each training sample, storing the results in <code>d</code>. Specifically, the distance between the test sample <code>new_irises[i]</code> and the training sample <code>irises[j]</code> is stored in the element <code>d[i][j]</code>. Now, for each test sample, we need to find the <code>k</code> training samples with the smallest distances to it. Note that you should store the indices of the nearest samples, not the distance values themselves.
